# Ruby Challenge: Reverse a given input such as the string "Hello World!" to result in "!dlroW olleH"

# this following puts statement will do all of the work for you(puts input.reverse), but, there is an alternative way to do this which produce the same result
# try not to "cheat" with the reverse method :)


def reverser(input)
	# Write the necessary code in here!
end

reverser("Hello World!")
#make sure that this method call to reverser will return "!dlroW olleH"
reverser("I am a great programmer")
#make sure that this method call to reverser will return "remmargorp taerg a ma I"
